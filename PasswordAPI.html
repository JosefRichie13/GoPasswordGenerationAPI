<p>This repo has the code for a Password Generation App Backend. </p>
<p>The below REST API endpoints are exposed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>GET /generateAPassword</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This endpoint allows you to generate a strong password. It requires 4 query params to be sent.<br><br>
The Query Parameters are</p>
<pre><code>?capLetters=&lt;NO_OF_CAPTIAL_LETTERS_IN_THE_GENERATED_PASSWORD&gt;
?smallLetters=&lt;NO_OF_SMALL_LETTERS_IN_THE_GENERATED_PASSWORD&gt;
?numbers=&lt;NO_OF_NUMBERS_IN_THE_GENERATED_PASSWORD&gt;
?specialChars=&lt;NO_OF_SPECIAL_CHARACTERS_IN_THE_GENERATED_PASSWORD&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The response is a password using the params sent, e.g. if <code>?capLetters=5&amp;smallLetters=5&amp;numbers=5&amp;specialChars=5</code> is sent, then the response will contain a 20 character password.  </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>GET /generateALeetPassword</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This endpoint allows you to generate a Leet password. Leet passwords are words which have been replaced by similar looking non alphabets<br><br>
For example, a common password is <em><strong><code>starwars</code></strong></em> and this password can be cracked in 0 seconds, but leeting the same password results in <em><strong><code>S7@12|_|_|@12S</code></strong></em>, which will take 1 million years to crack.<br><br>
The Query Parameter is</p>
<pre><code>?word=&lt;PASSWORD_TO_BE_CONVERTED_TO_LEET&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>The response is the leeted version of the password that was sent.
